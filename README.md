# DWM

My personal dwm configuration.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:reyniersbram/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

## Updating dwm to have the latest changes

Set up the local git configuration to have the official dwm repository as 
upstream.

```sh
patch -p0 < gitconfig.diff
```
